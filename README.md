# Project Name:Bike_buyers project.

In the busy city of Metropolis, people were using bikes more for transportation. Local bike shops were selling lots of bikes, and they wanted to understand their customers better. I downloaded the messy CSV file with customer info and clean it. I used Excel to remove duplicates, fix dates, and add missing info. The data became neat and useful. Then, I made it look better by organizing it, adding titles, and using colors. I made a pivot table to study the bike buyers' details. I sorted them by age, marital status, education, gender, income, and region. I noticed that most bike buyers were young, meaning young people liked using bikes. To share my findings, I created a dashboard with charts and graphs in Excel. This project showed that using data analysis and Excel can give helpful insights and make the city more bike-friendly.
Data Cleaning

in this task, i needed to clean the data set by removing any missing or irrelevant data,formatting the data types correctly,removed any null or duplicate values and transform the data to a more usable form. after the data was cleaned, i prepared the data for modeling and performed EDA to explore  the relationships between genders and age brackets of bike buyers

Data Transformation:
Tranformed the data to create the following new colums:
* Average income per purchase
* Customer Age Brackets
* Customer commute

Insights:
* Most bike buyers are middle age
* Male middle age income earner purchase bike than the female
* people with short distance 0-1miles use bike as mode of transport than people with wide distance miles
* Education background has no limit on bike buyer usage







# Project Name:Data professional breakdown.

Poject Details.

The dataset contains information of data professional breakdown, current data role,current yearly salary,industry,  favourite programming language, country of residence, gender,level of education and ethnicity. The objective of this project is to use Poer BI to visualize the data and answer the following questions and more:
