#Bike_buyers project.

In the busy city of Metropolis, people were using bikes more for transportation. Local bike shops were selling lots of bikes, and they wanted to understand their customers better. I downloaded the messy CSV file with customer info and clean it. I used Excel to remove duplicates, fix dates, and add missing info. The data became neat and useful. Then, I made it look better by organizing it, adding titles, and using colors. I made a pivot table to study the bike buyers' details. I sorted them by age, marital status, education, gender, income, and region. I noticed that most bike buyers were young, meaning young people liked using bikes. To share my findings, I created a dashboard with charts and graphs in Excel. This project showed that using data analysis and Excel can give helpful insights and make the city more bike-friendly.

#Data professional breakdown.

AlexTheAnalyst, a data expert, conducted a big survey to learn more about the data field and career trends. They asked data professionals worldwide about their favorite programming languages, job titles, salaries, and how hard it was to start in the data world. I downloaded the csv file and used Power BI to make a cool dashboard with the survey results. It showed that data jobs are everywhere, and Python was the top choice for programming. The dashboard also displayed salaries for different roles, and data scientists and data engineers made the most money. Most people in the survey thought it was somewhat hard to get into data, so education and experience are important for newcomers.
